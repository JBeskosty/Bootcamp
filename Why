Closes #43
Adds a Hide images/Show images toggle button
@octo-org/octo-team what do you think? Should the default be images displayed or images hidden?

What is changing
Users now have a button to show/hide images ont the page
When images are hidden, a placeholder icon is displayed
The user's image preference will follow them to future pages

Under Profile Picture, click Edit
Click Upload a photo....
Crop your picture. When you're done, click Set new profile picture
